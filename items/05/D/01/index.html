	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">These images are of</span> negatives I collected from the Library of Congress that contain images marked to not be printed. Originally documented by the Farm Security Administration to preserve rural and folk life across the United States, these images have redundantly been marked to never have a second life. The hole-punching in and of itself is such a destructive act for the purposes of an archive, meant to preserve aspects of life and culture. 
I transformed these photos into a new object, a flip book, separate from their original purpose, and into something more formally playful—flip books that bounce and guide the ominous black orb created by the hole-punching across the frames.¹</p><br>
