	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">My friend Rebecca had been</span> building upon a collaborative typologies project for her body of work Workshop and asked me to contribute by creating a list of ways to classify <span class="italic">pain</span> because I had been reading her copy of Susan Sontag’s “Regarding the Pain of Others”. The exercise is based on <a href="../02/index.html">a short written piece by Georges Perec</a>.
