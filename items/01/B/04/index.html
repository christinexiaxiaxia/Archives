	<p class="italic">6-page digital document.</p>

	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">The comparisons that Mehrotra</span> makes between the ‘static’ and ‘active’ city and the ways in which our surroundings impact and reflect our day-to-day experiences of culture and social bonds aligns well with how I am trying to approach to what archive could or should be. Rather that conforming to permanence and rigidity, the fluidity and ephemerality of culture should be embraced and reflected in the ways that we document ourselves and each other. More on my thoughts on this work can be seen in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.¹</p>
