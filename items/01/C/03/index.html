	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">This project repurposed</span> vintage cigarette ads and propaganda to begin to unravel and reveal the beauty in the formal aspects and craft of such politically charged pieces of culture. While clearly not an apolitical work, this project still tries to avoid taking an explicit stance of the morality of the content it is repurposing and rather passes on the responsibility of judgement to the viewer. This idea of not prescribing a single truth or answer when giving old bits of culture a new life is very relevant to my work and research surrounding archives. Some additional short thoughts about this project related to my current work can be found in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.ยน</p>
