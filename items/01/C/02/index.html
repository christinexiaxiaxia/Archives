	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">This three-part project</span> was a great precursor to the current ideas I am working with surrounding archives, documentation, and storytelling. This project is built around the idea of preserving old ideas and pieces of culture, however flawed they may be, and to pose the question of how to bring them back to relevance with our contemporary needs without prescribing a single set answer. Some additional short thoughts about this project related to my current work can be found in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.ยน</p>
