	<p class="italic">Collected images from <a href="https://artbreeder.com/browse" target="_blank">Artbreeder.com</a>.</p>

	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">It was at this point</span> in my work where I pivoted away from actual taxidermy and archives and instead started to examine bias in less traditional ‘archives’. I explored the image-generating capabilities of the machine learning algorithm and began to discover how these uncanny human figures begin to creep in to the frame, despite the fact that none of the categories are meant to include people. More details about my thoughts and the rest of the project can be found in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.¹</p>
