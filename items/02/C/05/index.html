	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">After having attended</span> Trevor Paglen’s speaker event, <span class="italic"><a href="../../D/06/index.html">Machine Visions</a></span>, I was reinvigorated with new inspirations in how to approach the idea of gatekeeping within documentations of people and archival practices; Paglen was particularly focused on the biases that reside in the ways that qualitative judgement is constantly seeping into the seemingly infallible structures of machine learning. In this project he purposefully introduces a more narrative and judgemental approach in training a machine learning model to recognize and synthesize images of allegorical characters that represent the evils of capitalism. I find this approach in utilizing machine learning to begin to extract some more purposefully biased and ambigious images and stories is what I tried to achieve in my <a href="../02/index.html"><span class="italic">Human Artifacts</span></a> project. It also has opened up the possibility of more hands-on image synthesization that rely on my own trained models, rather than pre-existing ones. More about my thoughts on this work can be found in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.¹</p>
