	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">During a volunteer opportunity</span> for the Design Netherlands event hosted by the ADCC, I had come across the works of KesselsKramer. Particularly this photobook series where Eric Kessels assembles found photographs to reveal small and intimate stories or ends up weaving together an all new ambigious fiction. The images in these books are really quite beautiful, mysterious, and some times funny. The simple act of finding, collecting, and re-presenting existing images is extremely relevant to my engagement with archives, and particularly my project, <span class="italic"><a href="../03/index.html">Human Artifacts</a></span>, where I collect and sequence algorithmically created human figures to tell new narratives. More about this project can be found in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.²</p>
