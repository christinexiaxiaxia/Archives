	<p class="italic">News article.</p>

	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">I was led to the story</span> of Henrietta Lacks when Ali (Qadeer) had mentioned her ‘eternal’ life in the name of cancer research. The lack of consent from Lacks and her family, or even the lack of knowledge at all, of her living tissue being used, sold, and profitted from ties deeply into the ways that the images of anonymous people live on past the lives of and beyond understanding the unidentifiable subjects. Even looking at the two articles below, there is such a huge emphasis on the ways in which science and scientists are ‘honouring’ Lacks through their use of her living tissue, but completely disregards the lack of consent from her living relatives. These ideas of the exploitation of image and bodies of individuals for the sake of science and research led me to my <span class="italic">Grave Eternity</span> project. More about this project can be found in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.¹</p>
