	<p class="italic">Ten pigmented inkjet prints, 13 7/16 × 10 1/4 in.</p>

	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">After having attended</span> Trevor Paglen’s speaker event, <span class="italic"><a href="../../D/06/index.html">Machine Visions</a></span>, I was reinvigorated with new inspirations in how to approach the idea of gatekeeping within documentations of people and archival practices. This work in particular highlights just how compelling the act of selection and curation can be in creating an intriguing and rich narrative; these high-resolution portraits with their subtle small boxes and numbers tranform a series of rather mundane photographs into a exposure of the ways in which we categorize ourselves.
	This topic of physiological study and categorization led to a my <span class="italic">Grave Eternity</span> project. More about my thoughts this on project can be found in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.¹</p>
