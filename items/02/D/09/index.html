	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">THIS IS A SMALL VIEW OF</span> my piece, <span class="italic">Grave Eternity.</span>¹ It is a web-based installation and performance piece that requires participants to take a few minutes to respond to a portrait of the man featured in the frame through drawing or writing. I then collect people’s contributions and use a staple gun to violently attach them to the wall, surrounding the frame with eclectic and mostly uninformed reactions to the subject of the image.</p>

	<p class="comments">The man in the image is Francis Galton, one of the early contributors of racial sciences and creator of term eugenics—the practice of correlating physiology to intellect and taking action and affecting policy to reflect their beliefs. This piece is an act of disenchantment towards Galton—an “anti-shrine”, unceremonious and misinformed. It removes the power of controlling his own public perception by re-appropriating his image and his personal history to endlessly loop and generate. Similarly to how the photos of anonymous individuals documented during expeditions rest in archives or databases completely separated from any shred of their actual humanity or real self, I have created a ritual and “alter” to create the same experience for this scientist, no longer allowing his image rest peacefully.</p>
