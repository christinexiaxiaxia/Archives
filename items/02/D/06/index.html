	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">After having attended</span> Trevor Paglen’s speaker event, <span class="italic"><a href="../../D/06/index.html">Machine Visions</a></span>, I was reinvigorated with new inspirations in how to approach the idea of gatekeeping within documentations of people and archival practices.

This topic of ways in which the study and categorization of people led me to the critical look at anthropology and ethnography within my <span class="italic">Grave Eternity</span> project.
