	<p class="italic">Essay.</p>

	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">After having attended</span> Trevor Paglen’s speaker event, <span class="italic"><a href="../../D/06/index.html">Machine Visions</a></span>, I was reinvigorated with new inspirations in how to approach the idea of gatekeeping within documentations of people and archival practices; Paglen was particularly focused on the biases that reside in the ways that qualitative judgement is constantly seeping into the seemingly infallible structures of machine learning. This essay describes his and Kate Crawford’s findings after launching a website, ImageRoulette, where users could upload photos and have the trained model from the world’s most proliferate machine learning model ImageNet label the people identified in the image. The results revealed the judgemental nature of this seemingly infallibly accurate or objective system. These ideas of the biases that lay in our attempted objective measurements and categorizations of people led me back to expeditions and anthropology, which I get into in my <span class="italic">Grave Eternity</span> project. More about my thoughts on this work can be found in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.¹</p>
