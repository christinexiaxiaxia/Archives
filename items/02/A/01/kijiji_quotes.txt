Paw print bike taxidermy

$30.00

Ottawa
06/09/2019

Combined my love for pets and bikes in this one of a kind hanging rack.
Bicycle taxidermy is a cool way to keep parts out of the landfill while showing off your paleo bicycle coolness. They are a wonderful conversation piece that also speaks to your bicycling addiction and environmental consciousness. In addition they are a practical piece for hanging your bike, clothes, sporting goods, pet supplies, etc.
Handmade by me from up-cycled bicycle parts including vintage drop bars, aluminum stem, and a well loved saddle. The only new part is the one of a kind Louis Garneau paw print handlebar tape. It is mounted on a handmade solid wood plaque painted light grey (with a paw print).
Last two pictures are from the web and are included to show the many uses of bicycle taxidermy. Check out Pinterest and Etsy for other examples and prices of bike taxidermy.

1940's/1950's Taxidermy Moose Leg Lamp (15.5" Tall w/ 4" Hoof).
This leg originally came from a LARGE moose & would look great in any avid hunter's home. Typically, I've only seen these lamps made from several deer legs (which are much smaller); as opposed to one large leg from a moose.
You cannot get more Canadian than this!

Van Ingens Leopard Rug excellent shape Taxidermy

Van Ingens Leopard Rug excellent shape history of van Ingens very rare piece of history $8000 OBO
The taxidermy firm was started in 1912 by Joubert’s father and was continued by his sons. It was internationally known for the fine quality of its products and was especially well known for its tiger and leopard trophies. According to a study done by P.A. Morris, a zoologist formerly at the Royal Holloway College, University of London, around 500 tigers were processed by the firm every year from the 1920s to the 1960s. Considering the widespread hunting for sport that took place in India before the passage of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, the van Ingens had a lot of work to do and, according to Mr. Swamy, employed around 200 people in the 1960s. Van Ingen & Van Ingen were Indian taxidermists operating from 1900-1998 in Mysore, South India. The firm was regarded as the best in the world completing taxidermy works for nobility as high as the Maharajahs of India to the Kings and Queens of foreign lands. Van Ingen were renowned for processing the highest volume of tigers and leopards as well as producing mounts in the most lifelike poses and utmost beauty, incomparable to any other taxidermists in the world. They produced taxidermy in the form of full mounts, heads on shields, flat rugs, and rug mounts with heads attached. Many valuable Van Ingen trophies are currently held by museums and in private collections. Van Ingen & Van Ingen was run by three brothers Botha, De Wet and Joubert Van Ingen who were trained by their father and founder of the taxidermy firm, Eugene Van Ingen. At the peak of business between the 1930's and 1960's, factory records show that Van Ingen processed over 400 tigers per year
