	<p class="italic">Collected text from listings on Kijiji for ‘taxidermy’ in the Ontario area.</p>

	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">I began my research</span> into the possibilities of connecting the concept of an ‘archive of feelings’ with taxidermy by searching locally on Kijiji. I hoped to familiarize myself beyond my surface-level understanding of taxidermy and wanted to explore more of the current colloquial culture and terms used within the space. I ended up with a fascinating look into the self-documented lives of the province’s buyers and sellers of hunting trophies and niche decor, along with <a href="../02/index.html">some rather striking images</a>. More details about my thoughts can be found in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>,¹ and some of my previous works that I mention can be found <a href="../../C/01/index.html">here</a>, <a href="../../C/02/index.html">here</a>, and <a href="../../C/03/index.html">here</a>.</p>
