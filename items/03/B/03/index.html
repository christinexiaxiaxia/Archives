	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">This project was created</span> using 6 selected audio tracks of <span class="italic">Amazing Grace</span> I collected from the Library of Congress’ digital archives. After having spent so much time sifting through the sterile databases of the Web, I decided to try and transform the valuable pieces of culture that some people had taken the time to document and catalog, and reinvigorate it with life and engagement. I ended up selecting <span class="italic">Amazing Grace</span> as the cultural artifact to bring back to life because of its expansive and tranformative history. The website is a cross-browser auditory experience where users are required to work together and maneuver the interface to mute the overlapping audio tracks to focus on a single one. In the same ways that <span class="italic">Amazing Grace</span> was able to shift and change its cultural value through the forces of a large population, the 6 audio tracks fade into one another with each user’ click to transform into a new melody altogether. More about this project can be found in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.¹</p>
