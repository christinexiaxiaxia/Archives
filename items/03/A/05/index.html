	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">This is a collection of</span> all of the images I collected from the American Museum of Natural History’s digital archives that were not a part of <a href="../03/index.html">the expedition portrait I collected</a>. A lot of these images capture spectators at the museum overlooking the static and lifeless recreations of cultures, people, and animals, and some others are simply interesting photographs captured during other miscellaneous expeditions, inlcuding some of the deteriorated negatives included in the “Outsiders” collection of printed photographs.¹ More about this project and my thoughts can be found in <span class="italic">The Archives</span>.²</p>
