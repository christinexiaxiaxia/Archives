	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">After being stuck on</span> what to do with <a href="../03/index.html">the portraits I collected from this Vernay-Hopwood expedition</a>, I searched for more related materials to this expedtion. I came across this book and while the contents themselves are not particularly relevant or interesting, I found the title to be somewhat useful with the opportunity to repurpose and reposition the use of the word ‘mammal’ to address the treatment of the people who were photographed as a part of this expedition as specimen to be examined that lack any humanity. More about this project and my thoughts can be found in <span class="italic">The Archives</span>.¹</p>
