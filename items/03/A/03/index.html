	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">This collection of photographs</span> has been the bane of my existence, having struggled to find a resolved outcome with this content since near the start of the semester. Most of my (unresolved) ideas have been floating around the idea of the power dynamics that are embedded into documentary practices and the control of visibility. The full online collection can be found <a href="../02/index.html">here</a> and more about this project and my thoughts can be found in <span class="italic">The Archives</span>.¹</p>
