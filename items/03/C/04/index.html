	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">Thinking about the term</span> ‘expedition’ outside of the specific context of anthropological expeditions and thinking about the excitement of space expeditions brings up more interesting thoughts to explore in terms of how we value the subjects of the images being used to document important discoveries and steps in science. In comparison to <a href="../../A/03/index.html">the expedition portrait I collected</a>, there is a lot more glamour even in the more mundane shots of the astronauts. More of my thoughts can be found in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.¹</p><br>
