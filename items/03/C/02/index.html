	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">This audio recording</span> is from the Library of Congress’ <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=partof:coal+river+folklife+collection&q=coal+river"><span class="italic">Coal River Folklife Collection</span></a>. While this song is sung during a baptism amongst the townspeople, I recommend listening the chorus of voices and splashing of water along with the series of images I created within my <span class="italic">American Memory</span> project and pay attention to this new more haunting story and purpose. See the series of images and more about this project in <span class="italic">The Archive</span>.¹</p><br>
