	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">Reihana’s collaged and active</span> mural is a fantastic piece to simply have experienced within the context of the work I have been making all year. She tackles the ideas of melting fiction into reality as well as reclaiming narratives which are both extremely relevant to my themes of the disinterment of people’s pasts and the power of visibility.
