	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">EARLY ON THIS SEMESTER</span> I paid a visit to the Toronto Archives—it wasn’t too helpful with the kind of research that I was hoping to do. There were an incredible amount of barriers (the ‘vibe’ was off) and the process to actually pull any boxes or make requests has a few days turnover. Seeing the space itself, you could quickly see just how many boxes were piled up¹ and additionally there are no photographic descriptors of objects or images that you could request to pull—<a href="../06/index.html">just general descriptions and keywords</a>. Below are some of the displayed images and letters at the archives:</p>
