	<p class="comments"><span class="comment-start">SAVE US ALL! IS AN</span>  edition of prints that satirizes the Royal Family’s perfectly planned and measured public image to highlight the gossip and tabloid news that keeps the family relevant and present in popular culture. While exaggerating the monarchy’s grandeur by transforming their balcony photo from the <a href="https://www.royal.uk/trooping-colour" target="_blank">Trooping the Colour</a> ceremony into the image of saints, these “holy” portraits are overlayed with loud and brash text—the background is composed of tabloid articles that gossip and speculate about the family’s lives and the foreground consists of the words from God Save the Queen stretched, scaled, and transformed into eye-catching headlines and titles. To see the process, please looks to The Archive¹ and <a href="../01/index.html">here</a>.</p><br>
